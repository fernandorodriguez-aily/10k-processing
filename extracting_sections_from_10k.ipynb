    "# Extracting 10-K Items from the Document\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on extracting key sections from a 10-K filing, such as *Business*, *Risk Factors*, and other mandated sections. Our objective is to segment the document and classify these sections according to the standard 10-K items, enabling us to later organize the content and build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent capable of reliably answering questions from the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will extract the sections of the document and their corresponding pages using **two methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using PDF Bookmarks**: Bookmarks, if available, often represent the main sections of the 10-K. We will extract them to identify the section names and their start pages.\n",
    "2. **Using Internal Hyperlinks from the Table of Contents (TOC)**: In cases where bookmarks are missing, we will rely on internal hyperlinks found in the 10-K's TOC to identify the sections and their start pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have extracted the sections and their page ranges, we will use a Large Language Model (LLM) to determine:\n",
    "- **The name of each section** (e.g., \"Risk Factors\").\n",
    "- **The corresponding 10-K item** (e.g., \"Item 1A: Risk Factors\").\n",
    "- **The start page** of the section.\n",
    "- **The end page** of the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM will classify each section by mapping it to a corresponding 10-K item, guided by a predefined prompt containing descriptions of the standard 10-K items.\n",
